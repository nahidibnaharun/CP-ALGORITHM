# ⚙️ CP-ALGORITHM

This repository contains **fundamental algorithms** commonly used in **competitive programming (CP)**.  
Each algorithm is implemented in **C++**, written for clarity and performance using STL where needed.

### ✅ To-Do for You:
- [ ] Rename folders logically (`Sorting/`, `Number_Theory/`, etc.)
- [ ] Move files into folders for better structure
- [ ] Add 1–2 lines of comment at the top of each `.cpp` file (e.g., what the algorithm does)
- [ ] Push the updated `README.md`
